"""
Claude Code UserPromptSubmit Hook for Cairn.

Handles two retrieval layers:
- Layer 1: First-prompt push — searches cairn using user's message on first prompt of session
- Layer 2: Cross-project injection — injects staged data from previous stop hook keyword search

Both inject via additionalContext (supported by UserPromptSubmit hooks).

MEMORY_FORMAT_SPEC = """MEMORY BLOCK (REQUIRED): End every response with a markdown link-definition block in this exact format:

[cm]: # '{"e":[{"t":"TYPE","to":"topic","c":"information-dense one-line content"}],"ok":true,"ctx":"s","kw":["keyword1","keyword2"]}'

The block is invisible when rendered. A Stop hook parses it and stores entries in a SQLite memory system that persists across sessions.

Required fields (short keys to save tokens):
- ok = complete (true|false). If false, also include rem (what still needs doing).
- ctx = context (s=sufficient | i=insufficient). If i, also include cn (what context is missing).
- kw = keywords array — topic words for retrieval.
- e = entries array (optional but expected when something was learned). Each entry needs t, to, c.

Entry types (t): fact, correction, decision, preference, skill, project, workflow, person.

When to add entries:
- User corrects you → t:correction (HIGHEST value — prevents repeating mistakes across sessions).
- Design choice made → t:decision (include alternatives rejected and why).
- New system/environment fact revealed → t:fact (versions, paths, configs).
- User states a preference → t:preference.
- A technique or command worked → t:skill (exact command).

Minimum valid block when nothing was learned:
[cm]: # '{"ok":true,"ctx":"s","kw":["topic","of","conversation"]}'

Rules:
- Every response must end with a [cm] block. No exceptions.
- One line per entry — no multi-line values. Pack what/why/context into that single line.
- Never fabricate. If you don't understand something, omit it rather than invent.
- On ANY new topic or question you have not received cairn context on this session: set ctx:i with cn:"specific terms from the question". The hook auto-searches and re-prompts you with relevant memories.
- Confidence feedback on retrieved entries you were shown: cu:["42:+"] (corroborates), ["17:-"] (irrelevant), ["17:-! reason"] (memory is wrong, annotate)."""
