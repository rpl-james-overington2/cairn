# === Deduplication ===
DEDUP_THRESHOLD = 0.95          # Cosine similarity above which entries are considered near-identical

# === Veracity (confidence reframed) ===
# Confidence now represents accumulated veracity — how well-corroborated a memory is.
# + means "consistent with what I'm seeing" (corroboration signal)
# - means "not relevant here" (no effect on confidence — irrelevance is not evidence against truth)
# -! means "proven wrong" (contradiction annotation with reason)
# Confidence is NOT used in retrieval scoring — similarity, recency, and scope handle ranking.
CONFIDENCE_DEFAULT = 0.7        # Starting confidence for new memories (unverified)

# score = w_similarity * similarity + w_keywords * keyword_overlap + w_recency * recency_decay + w_scope * scope_weight

# === Thin-retrieval escalation ===
# When push retrieval (Layer 3) returns too few or too-weak results, the next stop hook

# `docker exec code --install-extension`. Disabled when the directory is
# absent or empty.

# === Staged context ===
STAGED_CONTEXT_RETENTION_DAYS = 7   # Days to keep staged cross-project context for session resumption

# === Context bootstrapping ===

# === Query expansion — Type-prefix fan-out ===
# Memories are embedded as "{project} {type} {topic} {content}". A bare query misses the
# type prefix, reducing similarity. Fan-out searches with each type prefix and takes the
# max similarity per memory. ~7x more dot products per search (no extra model inference).

RRF_K = 60                         # Standard RRF constant — prevents single high rank from dominating

# === Mid-response memory checkpoints ===
# PostToolUse hook nudges the LLM to emit <memory_note> tags after high-signal tool calls.
# The stop hook collects and stores these notes. No extra LLM calls — the agent is already
# generating its next response; the note is just an inline tag.

# === Cross-encoder re-ranking ===

# === Concurrency ===
DB_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000          # SQLite busy timeout — wait up to 5s for lock release

# === Ephemeral DB ===
# Hot-path ephemeral tables (metrics, hook_state, pair_assessments) are isolated
